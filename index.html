                Our ala carte Menu has unique dishes created by our executive Chef, Chef Kim who draws inspiration through experimenting with different ingredients sourced from the diverse Kenyan landscapes to exotic ones that have found their place on Kenyans’ plates. Chef Kim spends a lot of time identifying fresh, safe, locally sourced ingredients for use in his recipes and employs French techniques of cooking to elevate food taste and flavor.
